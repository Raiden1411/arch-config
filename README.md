# Arch install

### After downloading this there are 3 steps to take

- First run the `chaotic-aur` script. Then make to appropriate change to pacman.conf to enable the chaotic-aur.

- The run ansible via the `install` script. It will configure 95% of the config and apps.

- Finally run the `post-install` script will configure and install the remaing software.

For now this needs to build ghostty from source. Since the repo is private this is a manual step and not configured here.
However this contains kitty so there is a shell that is accessibable via SUPER + SPACE or change the hyprland.conf file
